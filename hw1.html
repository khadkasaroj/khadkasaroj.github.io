Hi!, My name is Saroj Khadka.Yes that would be me riding a kids bike in the picture to the left. It was  my little niece's birthday and I wanted to show them that I too can have a little fun .. so I decided to run away with the little girl's bike and the kid with a ball is my nephew trying to catch  me and take away the bike. He says I am too big to be riding a small bike. Btw.. I have a adult size bicyle myself that I love to ride around peninsula. I am orignially from Nepal and have been living in the USA for last ten years. I have a love and hate relationship with this  country ,but that would be for next time. I  was enrolled at CSM  a long time ago however for some very personal reasons, I had to drop out of school.
For the past 10 years , I have regretted not finishing school . </br>
Not having a college degree made life much harder than it had to be.Without a college 
degree, it was hard to find a good paying job.So I had to have two or more jobs,working more
than 80 hours/week to earn a living. It is so expensive to be able to afford to live in California. The nice weather and good people in this state would not allow me to move to some other parts of the country.I have friends in other states that asks me to move to a much affordable place and I have simply denied.</p>

<p id="clear">
Even though , I was not attending school , I had had keen interest in learning HTML and CSS to create web pages.In future, I have a dream to start an not-for profit orphanage back in my home country and I want to create  my own web page for my orphanage .I have taught myself HTML  and CSS , in the past using the resources in the web and borrowing books from the local library. I am not very good at it because I have not have much practice on it but this time around I want to change it. Hence, I am now back in School cause being in school , I know I will be more disciplined to learn and practice. Maybe I will even complete school this time and get myself a college degree. I am also interested in app development and am enrolled in programming class here at CSM.
